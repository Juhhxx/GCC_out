An eldritch god reawakened in the middle of the beggining of the internet, but it quickly found itself overwhelming by the technological leap int echnology made by humans. 
With this, it lurked in the shadows, waiting and learning new ways of reaching the minds of the people.
When enough time had passed, the eldritch god had already learned the ways of coding and produced the game called Transformiced with the intent of subconsciously brainwashing people into behaving like mice, 
the animal representing of the Old God.
It was all going well with humans playing the game, reaching new peaks and rapidly accumulating power. But one thing the old god had not expected was that humans were
 only slaves to their own greed for new... more superficial games. With that, transformiced was left to die in the shadows of new, bigger, dumber games produced by bigger, more powerful engines 
and as such the God had found a new solution - to corrupt the biggest of the game engines almost as a virus and as such, achieving a free highway into the global human consciousness.

Our IT guy finds himself against this newfound lurking god while doing an IT routine inspection.
